# CryptoScripts
A collection of cryptocurrency scripts I've put together that include price charts, price feeds, top 100 chart, and various other scripts utilizing different APIs and JS libraries.

## Current Scripts
- JS Cryptocurrency Price Charts (Using Highstock for charts and Poloniex for data).

## Scripts Coming Soon
- JS Cryptocurrency Price Feed
- JS Cryptocurrency Search
- JS Cryptocurrency Top 100 (Market Cap, Volume, Price, Supply, etc. CoinMarketCap clone essentially).
- Steemit Pending Rewards Script

I plan to work on some more Steem/Steemit related scripts as well. Steemit is probably my favorite website and crypto project at the moment. So, I would like to contribute some value to the community!

## License
All of these scripts are licenses under the MIT license. They are free to use. Credit to me is not required, but it is appreciated.
